# Nvidia-Shield-Tv

Hello, good morning from Spain.
I would like to know if there is any application for Android that is able to "mount or map or virtualize or emulate" my Gdrive account on Android internal storage as another drive. 

Since PLEX disabled the "Plex Cloud" service I cannot access the content of my Gdrive account from Plex (I know the rclone and plexdrive options but both options cannot be used in Nvidia Shield Tv)

My question is basically if in Android ( Nvidia Shield TV ) it is possible to "mount or emulate or virtualize or map" my Gdrive account as if it was another unit of the Android system, and be able to read from it using PLEX ( just like rclone and plexdrive )

Or if there is a program like "nPlayer or Kodi or Infuse or Plex" that apart from synchronizing and reading from my Gdrive account can show "metadata" of all my movies and series ( Posters, interpreters, duration, summary, codecs used, rating, etc ... )

Thank you for reading all my comments and for your suggestions !
